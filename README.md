# Object Detection YOLO Project

## Project Overview
A YOLO-based object detection project for gemstone classification.

## Folder Structure
- `data/` - Datasets, images, and annotations
- `models/` - Model weights and definitions
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for experiments
- `scripts/` - Training, evaluation, and inference scripts
- `utils/` - Utility functions

## Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Place your data in the `data/` folder

## Usage
- Run training: `python scripts/train.py`
- Run inference: `python scripts/infer.py`

## Notes
- Large files (datasets, model weights) should not be pushed to GitHub. Use `.gitignore` to exclude them.
